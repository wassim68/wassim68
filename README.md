# 👋 Hi, I'm Wassim SADOUKI

I'm a backend-focused developer with a strong interest in building robust, real-time web applications and performance-driven systems. I enjoy combining clean backend architecture with practical, user-facing solutions, and I'm always learning new technologies to level up my craft.

## 💻 What I Work On

- 🔧 **Backend Development with Django**  
  Experience building web applications, user authentication systems, and real-time features using Django and Django Channels.

- 🏥 **Java Swing Applications**  
  Developed a full-featured hospital management system for handling patient types, input validation, and GUI design.

- 🎮 **3D Graphics Programming**  
  Built a custom 3D renderer using C++, OpenGL, and SDL. Features include camera movement, shading, texturing, and performance optimization.
